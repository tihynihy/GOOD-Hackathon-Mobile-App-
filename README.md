# Winners of the GOOD Hackathon 2022 by TelemachBH & ETF  

---

###### A 24-hour hackathon competition that required us to solve one of two problems:
1. **Education**
2. **Public Administration**

We picked the second topic.

Together with our "ZOI Code-84" team, we came up with a solution that won first place in a competition that had 15 teams and over 50
competitors from all cities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The application "rijesi.ba" is an application that is based on direct contact with people who can make a change in the local community.
The application has a similar structure to social networks, but its function is to publish everyday problems that arise in a local community.
Examples are: garbage that is not bought for days on the street, a collapsed house that can potentially cause damage to the environment, pipes that have burst, problems with parking, etc.
When a problem is published, it goes through the process of being separated from other problems. This process is a vote of all users of this application.
When a post reaches a certain number of votes, that post is filtered and becomes a "trending" problem that must be solved.
When a post is automatically selected in the feed, it is sent to the administration or people who have a great influence on the community and goes further through the protocol.
A post that does not have a large number of votes has a limit that lasts for 7 days. In the course of 7 days, if it is not separated into a trending group, it is considered a problem that does not pose a great risk to the community.

###### The application consists of two parts:
- Mobile version (Daily user)
- Desktop version (Administration)

The mobile version is for the everyday user who has the possibility to post problems, while the administrative side is the one that receives posts that are trending.

The mobile version is made in  ![Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-02569B?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=white)
